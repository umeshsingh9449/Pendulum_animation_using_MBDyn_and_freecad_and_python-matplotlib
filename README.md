# Pendulum_animation_using_MBDyn_and_freecad_and_python-matplotlib
This is a repo where I am uploading how to use the source code of Mbdyn (Multi body dynamics)to find the exact physics which can be applied on 3d on 2d models for animations, right now its just for pendulum which makes a sin wave while oscillating on Time vs position graph
